see how in sleep she seems to sing

What do I see in you? Oh boy. Oh boy, 
  
I see mountains and rivers a lifetime of joy, 
  
I see the sun shining on the greyest day, 
  
I see clouds of silver lining my way, 

What do I see in you? Oceans of blue, 
  
Colourful rainbows, morning dew, 
  
Trees of glory displaying leaves of green, 
  
I see goodness and beauty in all living things.
